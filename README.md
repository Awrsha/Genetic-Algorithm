# Genetic Algorithm with Mutation and Crossover for New Generation Generation

This project implements a genetic algorithm in both Python and C++ to generate a new generation of solutions through a combination of mutation and crossover operations. Genetic algorithms are a powerful optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection, allowing for the evolution of potential solutions to a problem over multiple generations.

## Introduction

Genetic algorithms are a subset of evolutionary algorithms that mimic the process of natural selection to evolve potential solutions to optimization and search problems. This project focuses on implementing a genetic algorithm with mutation and crossover functions to create a new generation of solutions iteratively.

## Algorithm Overview

1. Initialization: A population of potential solutions (chromosomes) is created randomly.

2. Evaluation: Each chromosome's fitness is evaluated using a user-defined fitness function that quantifies how well the chromosome solves the problem.

3. Selection: A subset of chromosomes is selected for reproduction based on their fitness. This subset is more likely to contain chromosomes that have higher fitness scores.

4. Crossover: Pairs of selected chromosomes undergo crossover, producing offspring with characteristics inherited from both parents.

5. Mutation: Some of the offspring's genes are subject to mutation, introducing small, random changes to diversify the population.

6. Termination: The process continues for a predetermined number of generations or until a termination condition is met (e.g., satisfactory solution found).

## Components

### Chromosome Representation

Chromosomes are represented as data structures containing genetic information. The structure of chromosomes should be defined based on the problem domain. For example, in a binary optimization problem, chromosomes can be represented as strings of 0s and 1s.

### Fitness Function

The fitness function quantifies the quality of a solution. It takes a chromosome as input and returns a fitness score that indicates how well the chromosome solves the problem. Higher fitness scores correspond to better solutions.

### Selection

Various selection strategies can be employed to choose chromosomes for reproduction. Common methods include tournament selection, roulette wheel selection, and rank-based selection.

### Crossover

Crossover involves combining genetic information from two parent chromosomes to produce one or more offspring. Different crossover techniques, such as one-point, two-point, or uniform crossover, can be applied based on the problem characteristics.

### Mutation

Mutation introduces small, random changes to individual genes within chromosomes. This helps maintain diversity in the population and prevents convergence to local optima.

### Termination Condition

The algorithm terminates when a specific condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or achieving a satisfactory solution.
